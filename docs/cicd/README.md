# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

## What is CI/CD?

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a set of practices and principles that help development teams deliver code changes more frequently and reliably.

### Continuous Integration (CI)
CI is the practice of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. Each integration is verified by automated builds and tests to detect problems early. Key aspects include:

- Automated building and testing of code
- Code quality checks
- Early detection of integration problems
- Consistent code style and standards

### Continuous Delivery (CD)
CD extends CI by automatically preparing code changes for release to production. It ensures that code is always in a deployable state through:

- Automated deployment processes
- Environment consistency
- Release readiness verification

## Our CI/CD Implementation

In this project, we use GitHub Actions to implement our CI/CD pipeline. Here's what happens when you push code to any branch:

### 1. Code Quality Checks
- **Commit Linting**: Ensures commit messages follow consistent standards
- **Code Formatting**: Uses [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to verify consistent code formatting
- **Import Organization**: Uses [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) to check proper import ordering
- **Style Checking**: Employs [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for code style verification
- **Type Checking**: Validates static types using [pyright](https://pyright.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

For the commit linting, we use [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) with the configuration set in the file [.commitlintrc.config.json](../.commitlintrc.config.json).

### 2. Testing
- Automated tests run using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
- Tests execute in a controlled Python environment
- Multiple Python versions can be tested (currently set to Python 3.13)

### 3. Development Workflow
1. Make your code changes
2. Push to any branch
3. GitHub Actions automatically runs all checks
4. Review the results in the GitHub Actions tab
5. Fix any issues if checks fail
6. Merge to main branch when all checks pass

## Viewing CI/CD Results

You can view the results of these automated checks:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Select the workflow run you want to inspect
4. Review detailed logs and results

This automation helps maintain code quality and reliability while allowing rapid development and deployment.
